# My-First-Website
The website i did for YONTEK student society

1-My first pull
  -The website needs a calendar for the events of the society.
  -The website isn't responsive for now.
  -When user choose dark mode if they refresh page it becomes white mode again i think ican fix this with jsquery.\n
2-My second pull
  -I added the other pages
  -I made the dark mode state saved so if user refreshes the page or go to a other page it stays in the same mode.
  -The website still isn't responsive 
  -The calendar is yet to be added.
3-My third pull
  -Website is responsive now
  -There is a embedded google calendar for the events of the society
  -Website is  completed
